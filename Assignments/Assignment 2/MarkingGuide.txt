CMPT 213 Assignment 2 Marking Guide
Peer Feedback Analysis Tool

Assignment must be done individually.

Total =  [100] marks.

[20] Single Group
	* Tested with data for 1 group with 4 students
	* This requires correctly finding and reading JSON files, correctly processing
	  feedback to generate correct and well-formatted .CSV file.

[20] Multiple Groups
	* Tested with a data set that has multiple groups, with possibly different 
	  number of students per group
	* This requires correlating students into correct groups
	* Must generate correct and well-formatted .CSV file.

[20] Processing Other Valid Data
	* Code will be tested with ~10 other valid data sets to assess how tool handles correct
	  data.

[30] Error Handling
	* PROGRAM MUST EXIT WITH ERROR CODE -1 WHEN THERE IS AN ERROR.
	* Code will be tested with ~15 invalid data sets which should each cause error(s).
	* Must print reasonable error message in each case.	

[10] Object Oriented Design
	* Reasonable class architecture using at least 3 non-trivial classes.
	* Private fields, well named methods.

[ 0] Correctly follow coding style guide.
	(No marks *given* for following style guide; able to lose up to ~15 marks for very poor style)
	* Very minor violations have no penalty (ex: having "int myCount=0;" (spacing wrong))
	* Lose a few marks for consistent problems (like always getting the spacing wrong).
	* Larger penalties possible for horrific code (up to not being marked!)

	Some specifics to check
	* JavaDoc comment on each class (not needed on methods/fields)
	* Correct indentation, brackets, spacing (use IDE's reformat if needed).
	* Good intention revealing class, method, and variable names.
